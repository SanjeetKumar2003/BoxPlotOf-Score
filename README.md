Problem Statement
You are a data analyst working for a school district.
The principal has asked you to analyze the exam scores of students from
different classes to compare their performance.
Your task is to create a box plot that visualizes the distribution of exam
scores for each class.
The data consists of exam scores for three classes: Class A, Class B, and
Class C.
Each class has 30 students.
The scores are on a scale of 0 to 100.
Your objectives are:
Generate sample data for the three classes.
Create a box plot using matplotlib to compare the exam scores across the
three classes.
Properly label the x-axis with class names and the y-axis with "Exam
Scores".
Add a title to the plot: "Comparison of Exam Scores Across Classes".
Display the plot.
Write a Python script that accomplishes these tasks.
Make sure to use appropriate data structures and matplotlib functions to
create an informative and visually appealing box plot.
